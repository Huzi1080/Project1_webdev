    <h3>Weightlifting</h3>
    <p>I go to the gym 4-5 times a week as part of my regular fitness routine. I've been weightlifting consistently for about 2 years now. I enjoy staying active, which also serves as a way of relaxing. If you're wondering, my workout split usually consists of push, pull, legs, along with cardio in between the week.</p>

    <h3>Working on My Car</h3>
    <p>I've always had a passion for cars. I own a Lexus IS 250, and I enjoy making small improvements like upgrading the intake, suspension, and handling maintenance to keep it in good shape. In addition, I've had the car for about a year and 8 months, during which I enjoy driving and taking care of it.</p>

    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <p>I haven’t traveled outside the U.S. yet, but I love visiting new places. I’ve been to California, Boston, Tennessee, Michigan, and Kentucky, and I hope to travel internationally soon.</p>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <p>I enjoy cooking and try to make time for it whenever I can. I often find new recipes online to experiment with different pastas and dishes. My go-to meal is steak with eggs and asparagus, especially after a workout. I also like to meal prep, making a variety of meals like butter chicken with rice, chicken parmesan, and more.</p>
